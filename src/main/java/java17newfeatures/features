1- Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (JEP 356)
So, it's easier to use different algorithms interchangeably, and it also offers better support for stream-based programming:

2-Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview)
This is another step toward pattern matching by enhancing pattern matching for switch expressions and statements.
It reduces the boilerplate necessary to define those expressions and improves the expressiveness of the language.

3-Vector API (Second Incubator) (JEP 414)
The Vector API deals with the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) type of operation, meaning various sets of instructions executed in parallel.
It leverages specialized CPU hardware that supports vector instructions and allows the execution of such instructions as pipelines.
Everyday use cases for this operation are scientific algebra linear applications, image processing, character processing,
and any heavy arithmetic application or any application that needs to apply an operation for multiple independent operands.
